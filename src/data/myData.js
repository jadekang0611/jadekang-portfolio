            Since I left my CPA behind to pursue my dream job to be a tech
            startup founder, I tried to build and launch a few platforms in the
            mentoring and networking ecosystem. Without legitimate software
            engineering knowledge and experience, I failed and only burned cash.
            Upon the completion of the Software Engineering Immersive program,
            with more than basic knowledge in CS and software engineering, I had
            a better product idea - building a sass for coding bootcamps where
            students can practice algorithms, share their learnings and job
            search journeys with their career advisors and institutions can
            track students’ performance and effectively get insights in
            students’ job search process and results in one place.

          <p>
            Upon gaining some work experience of using react and knowing
            JavaScript, HTML, CSS, NodeJS, and Firebase from GA, I was finally
            able to develop. As a co-founder and a frontend engineer, I led
            preliminary user research and interviews, gathered business
            requirements, then turned our initial design to the frontend code.{' '}
            During the MVP development, I solely contributed to the frontend of
            the application using React and Bootstrap. Once we decided to
            rebuild our student-side application frontend with our own custom
            Robin design and restructure our database and APIs, I transitioned
            from frontend engineer to fullstack engineer. As a new fullstack
            engineer, I was responsible for designing our database with Firebase
            (NoSQL) and building our endpoints in NodeJS using firebase
            functions for the backend. Additionally, I was a main developer for
            turning Figma designs to code by designing the frontend UI of the
            new Robin using React and Material-UI along with

            During the MVP development, I was still a very inexperienced one who
            only had 6 months of frontend work and couldn’t effectively use
            React, Bootstrap, or NodeJS. Therefore, I experienced a very steep
            learning curve, especially when building our own IDE to run a user’s
            code inputs. Within 2 months after the initial Robin application, I
            was able to build the frontend UI using React more efficiently and
            build the application highly modular. The real challenges at this
            time were with authentication of various bootcamp students and
            securely updating and maintaining their sensitive data.

            During my study at General Assembly, my colleagues and I attended
            many career service related meetings and performed various
            assignments every week as part of our coding bootcamp program. It
            was apparent that while 60 students were assigned to one single
            career advisor, there was no tool for the advisor to quickly view
            each student’s career service tasks and additional performance
            instead of spreadsheets. As soon as we gained enough student users,
            we reached out to a couple mid-size bootcamps and decided to build a
            centralized platform for career advisors to monitor students’
            outcome performance, portfolios, and outcome activities.

            After we released our first Robin Application in late March 2020, we
            experienced a fast growth in the bootcamp community. Students in
            various coding bootcamps such as General Assembly, LearningFuze,
            Redwoods Academy, Springboard, HackReactor, AppAcademy discovered
            our application and used it daily to practice algorithms and
            computer science. As we were getting 20 new signups every day
            without any marketing, we started to see an increased number of
            general questions about the application and requests for specific
            needs for some bootcamps. Up until this point, we could easily
            address questions and didn’t pay much attention to communicating
            with users. Starting in June, my cofounder and I were invited to
            speak at many startup events and AMAs, then we realized that it
            would have been better if we could make our product information and
            our vision more accessible to the public with our brand identity.
            That’s how we gathered business requirements and started to work
            with our UI designer for our website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before our big AMA event at CareerKarma in July, we had to build and
            deploy our website in 2 weeks. Therefore, we had to properly
            allocate our tasks among 3 developers and decide which css framework
            to use and overall structure of the frontend with react. I
            configured our github repository, branches, and set up our local
            environment. Based on the design and team discussion, I discovered
            three pages to have consistent layout with a few differences, thus I
            initiated the frontend work with more modular component styles. I
            built the site using react and bootstrap for our frontend. As our
            senior developer was spending her majority of time on the next
            version of our enterprise application, I performed code review,
            tested the sites, and passed or failed the code based on acceptance
            criteria.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having time constraint and no responsive designs, we had to quickly
            but accurately guess and target each media query for the
            responsiveness of the site based on the original Figma design. To
            reduce duplicate styles for the list of media queries and
            efficiently run the development, I suggested and implemented one
            central location that holds specific styles for all media queries.

            Due to the unchanging severity of the COVID-19, Korean government
            requires every business to take visitors' or customers' personal
            information and temperatures and maintain all records. Many
            businesses have devices to capture a customer's QR code to get their
            personal information from their phones via Kakao or Naver; however,
            small private businesses can't afford such a device. Therefore,
            people at many places take each visitor's temperature, manually
            track their personal information and temperatures on papers
            everyday. Furthermore, they often use the same paper that has
            previous information of many visitors over two or three days, each
            person's personal information is accessible to anyone. Upon my user
            research and interviews, I discovered that manual entries of each
            visitor's temperature takes time and gets lost though government
            officials often request small businesses to send them a compiled
            report that shows all entries over a certain period.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as I gathered business requirements, I designed a simple
            user flow, and structured my data models including user model, log
            model, and customer model which were ultimately designed in my
            NodeJS, Mongoose, and MongoDB. To practice and improve my skills in
            MongoDB and NodeJS, I built my REST API using NodeJS, MongoDB,
            Mongoose, and Express instead of Firebase. I tested and validated
            each endpoint using Postman. I also enhanced security and
            authentication of the application by implementing custom user input
            validation using Joi, bcrypt, and JWT. Upon the completion of the
            backend, I built the frontend with React and Material-UI and used
            Axios to fetch data from the api. Lastly, I built a PDF report file
            generator feature using jsPDF that lets a user generate a searched
            temperature log result in PDF on the client-side.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            From building this application to deploying it live, I’ve
            encountered several roadblocks: (1) working with jsPDF in React and
            (2) working with MongoDB. Firstly, enabling the HTML5 client-side
            solution for PDF generation using jsPDF with React in Korean was
            very challenging mostly due to lack of documentation and outdated
            solutions all over the Internet. Another one is that after I built
            my major applications’ apis with Firebase functions most of my time,
            my knowledge in MongoDB and NodeJS was disappearing. To turn it into
            an opportunity, I reviewed MongoDB documentation, practiced querying
            and somewhat slowly, but accurately built my backend following the
            MVC structure. This was quite a challenging project but at the end
            it turned out to be one of the most rewarding projects that I have
            completed.

            Initially, I didn’t plan to have a full website for Tempture
            application. However, once I released the MVP version to a couple of
            eSmart Habeob Learning centers in Seoul, I was reached out by some
            more small bakery and cafe owners that own major brands - Tous Le
            Jours and Pascucci in Gangnam, Seoul. To provide a better user
            experience and share more useful information, I decided to design
            and build the main Tempture website where people can learn about the
            application, COVID19 status, and also simply download custom
            designed posters for free to increase the safety during this
            unprecedented time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because I wanted the development of the website to take less than 3
            days without unnecessary road blocks, I decided to use React and
            Material UI for my frontend and deployed it to heroku. I used Canva
            to design my custom posters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the fact that I did not have a UI design for the project,
            using Material-UI and concepts, I believe that I picked appropriate
            colors and designed the site to be user friendly spending no more
            than 15 hours on this project.

            My former coworker who works closely with blockchain startups in
            Seoul reached out to me in May 2020 about whether or not I would be
            interested in assisting an education blockchain startup with
            building and releasing their product to the market. With my passion
            in transparency in education and modern education technology, after
            3 in-person meetings with the founders of the startup called
            Edubloc, Inc., they decided to put me in charge of running the
            project with responsibilities surrounding redesigning the product
            concept and managing the frontend development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both the company and I knew that I was the best candidate for the
            project since I have solid experience in developing in an agile
            environment, running standups, managing projects, hiring personnel,
            and most importantly building a startup. The client had a failed
            product that was not functional and was missing source code after
            burning approximately $50,000 over the course of one year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the stakeholders’ new plan to apply to a government-run demo
            event in November 2020, instead of using the previous generic
            roadmap and incomplete business requirements, I guided the client
            into solidifying business requirements that were realistic and
            aligned with the company’s short-term vision. Then I turned those
            into technical requirements that could be accomplished with the
            company’s budget and timeline. I determined the most appropriate
            technologies to be Angular or React using Bootstrap for the web
            application and Ionic with Angular for the mobile application
            considering that both applications would be MVPs and were needed to
            be developed within a short amount of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I presented the selected technologies to the stakeholders and, upon
            approval, I started to interview candidates based on their technical
            skills, communication skills, commitment, and knowledge of
            blockchain. Once developers and a UI designer were onboard, as a
            Scrum Master, I ran a daily standup with both the developers and the
            designer to ensure a successful project completion and identified
            any roadblocks while keeping track of individuals’ status and
            backlogs. As a Project Manager / Product Owner, I gave continuous
            status updates to the stakeholders with an intention to receive
            feedback from them as quickly as possible to minimize any setbacks.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            Challenge/Success: With the proper execution plan and agile
            strategy, I was able to meet the project deadline of 2 months and
            delivered the final product to the client. Starting in the earlier
            phase of the project, I collaborated with Samsung developers and
            DreamSecurity, a leading Decentralized Identifiers software company,
            to discuss the user flows, business requirements, and the frontend
            development of the applications. I had a great opportunity to
            successfully turn someone’s idea into a tangible business product as
            an external Project Manager / Product Owner, but at the same time,
            this experience reminded me again that everyone involved in a
            product’s development must clearly understand and share business
            vision and priorities to ensure that product development is
            optimized.

            Both the company and I knew that I was the best candidate for the
            project since I have solid experience in developing in an agile
            environment, running standups, managing projects, hiring personnel,
            and most importantly building a startup. The client had a failed
            product that was not functional and was missing source code after
            burning approximately $50,000 over the course of one year.

            Under the stakeholders’ new plan to apply to a government-run demo
            event in November 2020, instead of using the previous generic
            roadmap and incomplete business requirements, I guided the client
            into solidifying business requirements that were realistic and
            aligned with the company’s short-term vision. Then I turned those
            into technical requirements that could be accomplished with the
            company’s budget and timeline. I determined the most appropriate
            technologies to be Angular or React using Bootstrap for the web
            application and Ionic with Angular for the mobile application
            considering that both applications would be MVPs and were needed to
            be developed within a short amount of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I presented the selected technologies to the stakeholders and, upon
            approval, I started to interview candidates based on their technical
            skills, communication skills, commitment, and knowledge of
            blockchain. Once developers and a UI designer were onboard, as a
            Scrum Master, I ran a daily standup with both the developers and the
            designer to ensure a successful project completion and identified
            any roadblocks while keeping track of individuals’ status and
            backlogs. As a Project Manager / Product Owner, I gave continuous
            status updates to the stakeholders with an intention to receive
            feedback from them as quickly as possible to minimize any setbacks.{' '}

            Challenge/Success: With the proper execution plan and agile
            strategy, I was able to meet the project deadline of 2 months and
            delivered the final product to the client. Starting in the earlier
            phase of the project, I collaborated with Samsung developers and
            DreamSecurity, a leading Decentralized Identifiers software company,
            to discuss the user flows, business requirements, and the frontend
            development of the applications. I had a great opportunity to
            successfully turn someone’s idea into a tangible business product as
            an external Project Manager / Product Owner, but at the same time,
            this experience reminded me again that everyone involved in a
            product’s development must clearly understand and share business
            vision and priorities to ensure that product development is
            optimized.
